# cs340-Portfolio-Project

This is SQL database project that creates a database for a fictional store called Ciani Synths.
This project used Flask and Python in combination with Jinja templates and mySQL.

This project is largely based on the CS 340 starter code with the exception of code in purchases and orders (javascript functions addPurchaseItem and addOrderItem), which are based on  'Flask-WTF forms'. Here are all the citations:
