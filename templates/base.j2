      <p>
        Ciani Synths is a boutique synthesizer showroom in Portland, Oregon, selling 400 synthesizers
        annually. The store maintains a small inventory of playable synthesizers, allowing customers
        and community members to try out and experiment with some of the owner&apos;s favorite keys.
        <br>
        <br>
        In an effort to increase cash flow and compete with e-commerce giants, Ciani Synths is
        launching a website. As a licensed retailer for several major synthesizer manufacturers&#x2014;Roland,
        Moog, Korg, Arturia, Elektron, and Sequential&#x2014;customers can purchase synthesizers directly
        from the Ciani Synths website. A database-driven website will record sales which are
        represented by Orders placed by Customers and allow Ciani Synths to make Purchases from
        Manufacturers, which will result in a dropship delivery to Customers.
